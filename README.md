# iWantToStudyZA

This is going to be a website where prospective university students can see which universities offer which programmes.

It is supposed to be an all-in-one platform where you can get information about any degree you want to study at all public universities in South Africa.

It is not complete as of yet.

the project only works locally at he moment by doing the following:
1. run the application in the terminal with python app.py
2. go to a web browser of your choosing and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

This project is a combination of my recently acquired skills in Web Development (HTML & CSS) and web scraping with python and BeautifuleSoup.
